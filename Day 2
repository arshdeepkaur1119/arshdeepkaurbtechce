Our first lecture of the day was on Universal Human Values, and it was given by Dr. Priya Darshni madam.
A subject that delves into the essence of what it means to live a fulfilling and content life. We explored the concept of happiness and the state of contentment, discussing how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. The session was enlightening, providing a fresh perspective on how we can achieve true happiness.
We also shared real-life scenarios, which made the discussion more relatable and impactful.
Our second lecture was given by Dr. Arvind Dhingra.
